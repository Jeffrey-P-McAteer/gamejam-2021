(J) Overall design ideas:

 - offline puzzle-like 2d platformer
 - chaos + innovation: gravity amount changes based on some in-game reward mechanism
 - or building on the puzzle beginning, the puzzles require time-travel where the player
   gets to play through the level 3-4 times, with previous plays being replayed on top of the current
   run. This means the player will have to time things by remembering where they went?
