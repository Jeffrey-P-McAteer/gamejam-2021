# Goals

## Monday

Git repo up, hello-world level game built for win64. Linux/MacOS/Android/Website aren't anywhere on the roadmap.

Stretch goal: Github Actions compiling tagged commits + publishing `.exe` file under releases.

## Tuesday

Plan game UI, plan game mechanics (movement, items, in-game goals and reward mechanisms).

## Wednesday

Beginnings of player movement mechanics.

Beginnings of any appropriate "art" (mostly blender renders of simple scenes/stolen 2d artwork).

Stolen audio as well, I (J) don't have the skills for that.


## Thursday





## Friday




## Saturday


Submission + pizza party.
